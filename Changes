** denotes an incompatible change

0.5
	- removed memory leak associated with "return sub { ... }"
	- overhauled Config.pm, now maintains previous configuration
          when upgrading Mason (suggested by Patrick Kane)
	- made filename processing compatible with Windows 32
          (suggested by Rafael Weinstein)
	- removed requirement of File::Tools/File::Recurse, replaced
          with standard File::Find
	- switched output to STDOUT from $r->print, to facilitate
          chaining with other mod_perl tools
	- switched to standard argument processing code, now handles
          multi-part forms [modus]
	- added Parser options 'preprocess' and 'postprocess'
          (submitted by Philip Gwyn)
	- added Parser option 'in_package' (submitted by Philip Gwyn)
	- added facilities for using globals in components: Parser
          option 'allow_globals' and Interp method 'set_global'
	- ** changed behavior of reload_file mode to read directly
          from object files [mschmick]
	- reduced number of file stats when loading components
          [mschmick]
	- documented how to integrate Mason with Apache::Session
          [modus]
	- upgraded FakeApache/debug files to work with mod_perl 1.19
	- added documentation about how debug files work
	- mentioned mailing lists, masonhq.com web site, and FAQ in
          the documentation and README
	- improved documentation on how to integrate images and
          non-Mason hierarchies with Mason
	- differentiated mc_cache and mc_cache_self in the commands
          manual (suggested by Tom Hukins)
	- increased discouraging of SDBM, improved warnings when cache
          store fails (suggested by Patrick Kane)
	- fixed HTML documentation to work with IE (suggested by Fen
          Lebalme)
	- fixed infinite loop in ApacheHandler dhandler search
          (submitted by Chuck O'Donnell)
	- documented Parser method parse()
	- added cache actions 'expire' and 'keys'
	- corrected Parser to properly handle \ in components
          (submitted by Ken Williams)
	- took Preview out of Mason.pm; ApacheHandler used only if
          mod_perl environment
	- improved documentation about argument/GET/POST handling
          (suggested by Ken Williams)
	- added cache option 'busy_lock' (suggested by Dennis Watson)
	- inserted work-around for Perl 5.005 $r scoping bug
          (submitted by Rafael Weinstein)
	- fixed "new CGI" example in Components.pod (submitted by
          Austin Lin)
	- fixed "return if content-type..." line in handler.pl and
          Mason.pod (submitted by Patrick Kane)

0.4  Wed Jan 06 10:35:00 PST  1999
	- added support for using Perl profiler in conjunction with
	  debug files
	- fixed bug in previewer HTML trace introduced in 0.3
	- created Perl status section for Mason
	- removed most warnings when PerlWarn is on (suggested by
	  Philip Gwyn)
	- added code_cache_mode parameter to control caching of
	  components in memory
	- fixed mismatch between documentation and code with regards
	  to cache store events in system log.  The real event name is
	  CACHE_WRITE.
	- changed system logging to use canonical server name when
	  recording URI
	- field access methods inside Mason objects are now handled
	  with custom subroutines instead of generic AUTOLOAD,
	  improving performance
	- information for debug file is no longer collected if debug
	  mode is "none"
	- code to decline images and other non-text requests was
	  placed in default handler.pl and described in documentation
	  (suggested by Patrick Kane)
	- fixed server header output from debug files (suggested by Ewan
	  Edwards)
	- created a Mason bundle
	- created a CPAN "alias" from Apache::Mason to HTML::Mason

0.3   Wed Nov 25 17:00:34 PST 1998
        - added optional system logging of page requests, cache
          activity, component loading
	- deny directory requests so that index files will work in
          mod_perl 1.16+
	- removed reliance on several external packages (Date::Manip,
          CGI::Base, URI::Escape). This should reduce the
          amount of memory taken up by Mason processes and make Mason
          easier to install.
	- INCOMPATIBILITY: due to the removal of Date::Manip, the
          mc_date command will no longer work unless Date::Manip is
          explicitly used, and the syntax for the expire_at cache
          parameter and the Interp current_time parameter have changed.
	- added parser taint_check flag which allows Mason to work
          with taint checking on (suggested by Randal Schwartz)
        - added warning messages when returning 404 from ApacheHandler
	- improved cache locking with the use of separate lock files
	- Makefile.PL checks for required and optional packages
	- documentation fixes and improvements
	- removed obsolete and undocumented commands from Commands.pm
        - failure to write debug file is now a warning rather than
          fatal error
        - augmented "no configuration for previewer port" error
        - fixed $interp->exec to be able to return list
        - changed parser to remove ctrl-Ms instead of replacing with
          spaces
        - always call http_header hook, not just at top level
        - added global IN_DEBUG_FILE flag
        - renamed mc_call_stack to mc_comp_stack to match
          documentation

0.2   Fri Aug 21 08:54:13 1998
	- replaced File::lockf module, which could not port to some
          systems, with simple call to flock
	- corrected email address in README
	- fixed undeclared variable bug in preview component
	- the previewer did not work in basic versions of Perl 5.004
          due to an eval scoping bug. A workaround was put in place.
	- fixed expire_if cache option to pass correct argument to
          provided subroutine
	- empty argument section no longer parsing incorrectly
	- took out directory names from manifest which were causing
          errors on install
	- debug file is no longer prepared when debug_mode is "none"
	- use Preview.pm in Mason.pm
