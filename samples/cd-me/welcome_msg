Hello, and thanks for visiting CD-Me! We have acquired some GREAT buys for you during this last week. My Texan ZZ Top connection found a veritable warehouse full of unreleased bootleg material of unparalleled quality! If you like their early 70's work, you'll love this stuff. Visit the <a href="artist?artist=ZZ_Top">ZZ Top</a> page to see what there is.

I also have to tell you about the new collection of Verve Jazz Classics which was just released this week. We've got Charlie "Bird" Parker, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, and all your favorite crooners and tuners. Much of it is previously unreleased, live material from all-star jam sessions. Have you ever heard Bird and Diz trade licks with Billie Holliday on vocals? Now you can! Visit the <a href="genre?cat=jazz">Jazz Page</a> to pick up some incredibly hot tunes.
