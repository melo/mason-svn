Note: If you are seeing the source of the above pages as plain text,
it is because the server is assigning the content type "plain/text"
instead of "text/html".  The easiest way to remedy this is to put

    DefaultType  text/html

in your configuration file, and make sure mod_mime_magic is not active.
This will allow filenames with no extensions to be handled by Mason.
