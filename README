Welcome to Mason, a Perl-based web site development and delivery
system.  Mason allows web pages and sites to be constructed from
shared, reusable building blocks called components. Components contain
a mix of Perl and HTML, and can call each other and pass values back
and forth like subroutines. Components increase modularity and
eliminate repetitive work: common design elements (headers, footers,
menus, logos) can be extracted into their own components where they
need be changed only once to affect the whole site.

Other Mason features include a graphical site previewing utility, an
HTML/data caching model, and the ability to walk through requests with
the Perl debugger.

INSTALLATION

To install Mason, run the standard sequence:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

After Mason is installed, you will need to activate it by adding some
directives to your Apache configuration files, and customizing Mason's
Config.pm and eg/handler.pl files to match your system.

The included pod docs have been pre-converted to HTML for you and
placed in the htdocs/ directory. The Mason overview (a good place to
start) is in Mason.html.

WARNINGS!

* Don't use Mason with an older mod_perl DSO (dynamic shared object).

Using Mason with an older mod_perl DSO will cause your Apache server
to fail silently at startup. Red Hat 6.1 is one distribution that
includes such a broken mod_perl DSO.

The fix for this problem is to install Apache/mod_perl with mod_perl
compiled statically into the Apache binary.  Packages of Apache with a
static mod_perl are available around the net; check
http://rpmfind.net/ as a starting point.

Recent testing with Apache 1.3.12/mod_perl 1.24 compiled from source
on Linux 2.2.13 did not exhibit these problems.  Your mileage may
vary.

* Don't use Mason with taint checking on.

The current version of Mason interacts badly with a nasty taint bug in
Perl, causing unexpected behavior such as infinite loops.

GETTING HELP

The official Mason web site is at http://www.masonhq.com/.  There
you'll find Mason documentation, news, etc.

A recent copy of the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list is
included in this release under the faq/ directory.  The most
recent version is always available on the web site.

Several mailing lists exist for Mason users and developers. Full
information can be found at http://www.masonhq.com/maillist.html.

CODE EXAMPLES

The samples/ directory contains a few basic components as well as
a miniature commerce site built with components.

The Mason component archive (http://www.masonhq.com/arch/), launched
in November 1999, should be another good source of examples.

REPORTING BUGS

Send bug reports to the Mason mailing list for quickest response.
It is a good idea to search the mailing list archives first to see
if the problem has already been reported.

For all bug reports indicate your architecture, Apache/Perl/module
versions, etc. For installation problems send your handler.pl and
httpd.conf. For component problems try to isolate the bug in a single
small component or set of components, and send those.

CONTENT MANAGEMENT

There is a companion content management system for Mason, maintained
by Mark Schmick.  CM is a web-based interface to your component and
content files; it allows designers and programmers to work on a site
remotely without resorting to ftp or telnet. It supports
staging/production sites, RCS versioning of files, global content
searching, and a host of other features. CM is written entirely as a
set of Mason components.  Find out more and download a copy at
http://www.masonhq.com/Mason-CM/.
