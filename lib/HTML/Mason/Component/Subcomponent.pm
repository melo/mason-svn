=head1 NAME

HTML::Mason::Component::Subcomponent - Mason Subcomponent Class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of
L<HTML::Mason::Component|HTML::Mason::Component>. Mason uses it to
implement both subcomponents (defined by C<< <%def> >>) and methods (defined
by C<< <%method> >>).

A subcomponent/method gets most of its properties from its owner. Note
that the link from the subcomponent to its owner is a weak reference
(to prevent circular references), so if you grab a subcomponent/method
object, you should also grab and hold a reference to its owner. If the
owner goes out of scope, the subcomponent/method object will become unusable.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item is_method

Returns 1 if this is a method (declared by C<< <%method> >>), 0 if it is a
subcomponent (defined by c<< <%def> >>).

=item owner

Returns the component object that this subcomponent or method was
defined within.
