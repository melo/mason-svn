### Reimplement <%filter> with buffer stack and/or closures

out_mode (batch/stream)
batch: top level buffer is scalar
stream: top level buffer is $r->print
	scomp and filter must run component output to a scalar


buffer stack will be separate from component stack, because we will 
need a buffer for each comp(), <%filter>, <| |>, or user creation.

probably create $m->print, $m->out will do the same thing, depricated


Task #202
stacked output buffers
roll back output when error occurs (batch mode)
(stream mode will only stream until <%filter> <| |> or scomp happens)

Task #117
reimplement filters without $m->call_self
(buffer stack)
( could do it with current code, but it only allows one sink per 
  component stack level )

Task #201
subvert print() and $r->print

Task #231
$m->flush_buffer does nothing inside <%filter> or $m->scomp
(just exactly what _should_ it do??? 
 if it actually flushes, then the caller will not see anything
 or is the desired behavior: 
   comp:
     stuff the caller/filter will not see
    flush_buffer
     stuff the caller/filter will see
)

Task #210
abort inside filter or scomp does not display content
(#210 implies flush_buffer on exception, #202 implies clear_buffer on exception)
perhaps exception should clear buffer, but keep a copy of cleared data
in case user wants to flush instead.


Currently, each component has its own sink (on the component stack)
which writes to a (usually) shared buffer.
When the component exits, the sink is popped of the stack along with
the component.

+------+  +------+  +------+
| comp |  | comp |  | comp |
+------+  +------+  +------+
   |         |         |
   V         V         V
+--------------------------+
|  buffer                  |
+--------------------------+


For <%filter> or user buffers, there is no longer a 1-1 match between
buffers and components.  So how do we be sure to keep them in sync?

One way below, but if users can push/pop buffers, they may not do the right thing.

push_buffer
eval {
 ...
 flush_buffer
}
$unflushed_data = buffer
pop_buffer

OR

$level = push_buffer
eval {
  ...
  flush_buffer($level)
}
pop_buffer($level)


flush/clear _all_ output?
	flush_buffer(0);


comp:
# should push a \$scalar if the component has a <%filter>
push_buffer()  # default: same method as before
eval {
  run
  flush_buffer
}
$unflushed = buffer if buffer
pop_buffer
die if $@


scomp:
push_buffer(\$scalar)
eval {
  run
}
$data = buffer
pop_buffer
if $@ { $unflushed = $data ; die }
return $data


<%filter>:
... component body
$_ = buffer
... filter body


<%filter>:
push_buffer(\$scalar)
eval {
  component body
}
$_ = buffer
pop_buffer
die if $@
filter body 


$m->flush_buffer:
flush_buffer(0)  # all the way down


$m->clear_buffer:
clear_buffer(0)  # all the way down


( or maybe 0 is current buffer, undef is all the way down )
