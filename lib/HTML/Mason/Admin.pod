=head1 NAME

HTML::Mason::Admin - Mason Administrator's Manual

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual is written for the sysadmin/webmaster in charge of
installing, configuring, or tuning a Mason system.

=head1 SITE CONFIGURATION METHODS

There are three ways to configure a Mason site:

=over 4

=item *

Minimal configuration, relying on default Mason behavior. Simplest and least flexible.

=item *

Configuration via httpd.conf directives. Medium complexity and flexibility.

=item *

Configuration via a handler script (handler.pl). Most complex and most flexible.

=back

The next three sections discuss these methods in detail. We recommend
that you start with the simplest method and work your way forward as
the need for flexibility arises.

It is important to note that you cannot mix httpd.conf configuration
directives with a handler script.  Depending on how you declare your
C<PerlHandler>, one or the other will always take precedence and the
other will be ignored.

Mason is very flexible, and you can replace parts of it by creating
your own classes.  This documentation assumes that you are simply
using the classes provide in the Mason distribution.  Customizing and
subclassing is covered in the
L<Subclassing|HTML::Mason::Subclassing> document.

=head2 MINIMAL CONFIGURATION

The absolutely most minimal configuration looks like this:

    PerlModule HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler

    <FilesMatch "\.html$">
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
    </FilesMatch>

This configuration tells Apache to serve all .html files under your
document root through Mason.  The PerlModule line tells mod_perl to
load Mason once at startup time, saving time and memory.

=head2 CONFIGURATION VIA httpd.conf DIRECTIVES

Mason's configuration parameters are set via mod_perl's C<PerlSetVar>
and C<PerlAddVar> directives (the latter is only available in mod_perl
version 1.24 and greater).  Though these parameters are all strings in
your httpd.conf file, Mason treats them as if they were several
different types:

=over 4

=item * string

The variable's value is simply taken literally and used.  The string
should be surrounded by quotes if the string contains whitespace, and
these quotes will be automatically removed by Apache before Mason sees
the variable.

=item * boolean

The variable's value is used as a boolean, and is subject to Perl's
rules on truth/falseness.  It is recommended that you use 0 (false) or
1 (true) for these arguments.

=item * code

The string is treated as a piece of code and C<eval>'ed.  This is used
for parameters that expect subroutine references.  For example, an
anonymous subroutine might look like:

 PerlSetVar  MasonOutMode  "sub { ... }"

A named subroutine call would look like this:

 PerlSetVar  MasonOutMode  "\&handle_output"

=item * list

To set a list parameter, use C<PerlAddVar> for the values, like this:

 PerlAddVar  MasonPreloads  /foo/bar/baz.comp
 PerlAddVar  MasonPreloads  /foo/bar/quux.comp

As noted above, C<PerlAddVar> is only available in mod_perl 1.24 and
up.  This means that it is only possible to assign a single value
(using C<PerlSetVar>) to list parameters if you are using a mod_perl
older than 1.24.

=back

See L<HTML::Mason::Params|HTML::Mason::Params> for a full list
of parameters.

There is one special parameter that does not directly correspond to an
object constructor parameter, C<MasonSetEscape>.  This parameter
allows you to define escape codes just as if you were calling the
Interpreter's L<C<set_escape()>
method|HTML>::Mason::Interp/item_set_escape>.

This can be used as follows:

  PerlSetVar  MasonSetEscape  "escape_name => \&sub_ref"

So, for example, to change Mason's 'h' escape flag to only escape
'E<gt>', 'E<lt>', '"', and '&', you would do this:

  PerlSetVar  MasonSetEscape  "h => \&HTML::Mason::Tools::old_html_escape"

This variable can accept multiple parameters, with the C<PerlAddVar>
directive.

=head2 CONFIGURING VIA HANDLER SCRIPT

For maximum flexibility, you may choose to write a custom script to
create your Mason objects and handle requests.  In our documentation
and examples we call this script C<handler.pl> and place it in the
Apache C<conf/> subdirectory, though you may name it and place it
wherever you like.

The C<handler.pl> file is responsible for creating the AapcheHandler
object and supplying the many parameters that control how your
components are parsed and executed. It also provides the opportunity
to execute arbitrary code at three junctures: the server
initialization, the beginning of a request, and the end of a request.

Here is a simple C<handler.pl>, also provided in the C<eg/> directory:

   #!/usr/bin/perl
   #
   # A basic, functional Mason handler.pl.
   #
   package MyMason::MyApp;
   
   # Bring in Mason with Apache support.
   use HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler;
   use strict;
   
   # List of modules that you want to use within components.
   { package HTML::Mason::Commands;
     use Data::Dumper;
   }
   
   # Create ApacheHandler object at startup.
   my $ah =
       HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler->new
           ( comp_root => '/path/to/comp_root',
             data_dir   => '/path/to/data_dir',);
   
   sub handler
   {
       my ($r) = @_;
   
       my $status = $ah->handle_request($r);
       return $status;
   }
   
   1;

Copy this file into your Apache C<conf/> subdirectory, and place the
following into your httpd.conf:

    PerlRequire conf/handler.pl

    <FilesMatch "\.html$">
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler MyMason::MyApp    # notice - no ::ApacheHandler!
    </FilesMatch>

replacing MyMason::MyApp with a package name of your choosing. 

At this point, your configuration should act identically to a minimal
httpd configuration. You can now configure your server by:

=over

=item *

Adding parameters to the ApacheHandler constructor. e.g.

    HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler->new( ... );

=item *

Adding use statements for modules that you want to use within components. e.g.

=item *

Adding code before the handler subroutine, to be executed once by the parent
httpd process.

=item *

Adding code inside the handler subroutine, to be executed before or after
each request.

=back

=head1 SERVER CONFIGURATION

=head2 Component root

The component root (P<comp_root>) marks the top of your component
hierarchy.  When running Mason with the CGIHandler or ApacheHandler
modules, this defaults to your document root.

The component root defines how component paths are translated into
real file paths. If your component root is /usr/local/httpd/docs, a
component path of /products/index.html translates to the file
/usr/local/httpd/docs/products/index.html.

One cannot call a component outside the component root. If Apache
passes a file through Mason that is outside the component root (say,
as the result of an Alias) you will get a 404 and a warning in the
logs.

You may also specify multiple component roots in the spirit of Perl's
C<@INC>. Each root is assigned a key that identifies the root
mnemonically to a component developer. For example, in httpd.conf:

    PerlAddVar  MasonCompRoot "private => /usr/home/joe/comps"
    PerlAddVar  MasonCompRoot "main => /usr/local/www/htdocs"

or in handler.pl:

    comp_root => [ [ private => '/usr/home/joe/comps' ],
                   [ main    => '/usr/local/www/htdocs' ] ]

This specifies two component roots, a main component tree and a
private tree which overrides certain components.  The order is
respected ala C<@INC>, so I<private> is searched first and I<main> second.
(We chose the C<=E<gt>> notation because it looks cleaner, but note that
this is a list of lists, not a hash.)

Keys must be unique in a case-insensitive comparison.

=head2 Data directory

The data directory (P<data_dir>) is a writable directory that Mason
uses for various features and optimizations. By default, it is a
directory called "mason" under your Apache server root. You will need
to change this on certain systems that assign a high-level server root
such as F</usr>!

Mason will create the directory on startup, if necessary, and set its
permissions according to the web server User/Group.

=head2 External modules

Components will often need access to external Perl modules. There are
three basic ways to bring them in.

=over

=item 1

The httpd PerlModule directive:

    PerlModule CGI
    PerlModule LWP

=item 2

In the <%once> section of the component(s) that use the module.

    <%once>
    use CGI ':standard';
    use LWP;
    </%once>

=item 3

In a handler.pl:

    { package HTML::Mason::Commands;
      use CGI ':standard';
      use LWP;
      ... }

=back

Each method has its own trade-offs:

=over

=item *

The first and third method ensure that the module will be loaded by
the Apache parent process at startup time, saving time and memory.
The second method, in contrast, will cause the modules to be loaded by
each server child. On the other hand this could save memory if the
component and module are rarely used. See the mod_perl guide's tuning
section and Vivek Khera's mod_perl tuning guide for more details on
this issue.

=item *

The second and third method use the modules from inside the package
used by components (C<HTML::Mason::Commands>), meaning that exported
method names and other symbols will be usable from components.  The
first method, in contrast, will import symbols into the C<main>
package. The significance of this depends on whether the modules
export symbols and whether you want to use them from components.

=item *

The first and second method work with an Apache-only configuration,
while the third method obviously requires a handler.pl. On the other
hand, you approximate the effect of a handler.pl using a preloaded,
top-level autohandler.

=back

=head2 Declining image requests

Mason should be prevented from serving images, tarballs, and other
binary files as regular components. Not only will performance suffer,
but binary files may inadvertently contain a Mason character sequence
such as "<%".

There are several ways to restrict which file types are handled by
Mason.  One way is to use C<FilesMatch>, e.g.

    <FilesMatch "(\.html|\.txt|^[^\.]+)$">
     SetHandler perl-script
     PerlHandler HTML::Mason
    </FilesMatch>

This directs Mason to handle only files with .html or .txt extension,
as well as those files with no extension. The disadvantage of this
method is that the filename must exist for the C<FilesMatch> to match.
You will not be able to use L<dhandlers|HTML::Mason::Devel/dhandlers>
to catch non-existent files.

A second way is to use C<LocationMatch> to indicate the extensions
that should I<not> be served through Mason, e.g.

    <LocationMatch "\.(gif|jpe?g|png|gz)$">
     SetHandler default-handler
    </LocationMatch>

This will send all extensions not listed through Mason, regardless
of whether the file exists, thus working well with dhandlers. The
disadvantage of this method is that you have to explicitly list all
of the non-Mason extensions used on your site.

A third way, if you are using a C<handler.pl> script, is to include
a line like the following at the top of your handler() subroutine:

    return -1 if $r->content_type && $r->content_type !~ m|^text/|i;

This line handles requests for text/* MIME types, such as text/html
and text/plain, and declines others. The disadvantage of this method
is that it requires a bit of Perl code to run for every image request.

=head2 Securing top-level components

Users may exploit a server-side scripting environment by invoking
scripts with malicious or unintended arguments. Mason administrators
need to be particularly wary of this because of the tendency to break
out "subroutines" into individually accessible file components.

For example, a Mason developer might create a helpful shared component
for performing sql queries:

    $m->comp('sql_select', table=>'employee', where=>'id=315');

This is a perfectly reasonable component to create and call internally,
but clearly presents a security risk if accessible via URL:

    http://www.foo.com/sql_select?table=credit_cards&where=*

Of course a web user would have to obtain the name of this component
through guesswork or other means, but obscurity alone does not
properly secure a system.  Rather, you should choose a site-wide
policy for distinguishing top-level components from private
components, and make sure your developers stick to this policy. You
can then prevent private components from being served.

One solution is to place all private components inside a directory,
say /private, that lies under the component root but outside the
document root.

Another solution is to decide on a naming convention, for example,
that all private components begin with "_", or that all top-level
components must end in ".html". Then turn all private requests away
with a 404 NOT_FOUND (rather than, say, a 403 FORBIDDEN which would
provide more information than necessary). Use either an Apache directive

    PerlModule Apache::Constants
    <FilesMatch "^_">
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlInitHandler Apache::Constants::NOT_FOUND
    </FilesMatch>

or a C<handler.pl> directive:

    return 404 if $r->filename =~ m{^_[^/]+$};

Even after you've safely protected internal components, top-level
components that process arguments (such as form handlers) still
present a risk. Users can invoke such a component with arbitrary
argument values via a handcrafted query string. Always check incoming
arguments for validity and never place argument values directly into
SQL, shell commands, etc.

=head2 Allowing directory requests

By default Mason will decline requests for directories, leaving Apache
to serve up a directory index or a FORBIDDEN as appropriate.
Unfortunately this rule applies even if there is a dhandler in the
directory: /foo/bar/dhandler does not get a chance to
handle a request for /foo/bar/.

If you would like Mason to handle directory requests, do the
following:

1. Set P<decline_dirs> to 0.

2. If you are using a C<handler.pl> and it contains a "return -1" line
to decline non-text requests (as given in the previous section), add a
clause allowing directory types:

    return -1 if $r->content_type && $r->content_type !~ m|^text/|i
                 && $r->content_type !~ m|directory$|i;

The dhandler that catches a directory request is responsible for
setting a reasonable content type.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT

=head2 Global variables

Global variables can make programs harder to read, maintain, and
debug, and this is no less true for Mason components.  Due to the
persistent mod_perl environment, globals require extra initialization
and cleanup care.

That said, there are times when it is very useful to make a value
available to all Mason components: a DBI database handle, a hash of
user session information, the server root for forming absolute URLs.

Because Mason by default parses components in C<strict> mode, you'll
need to declare a global if you don't want to access it with an
explicit package name. The easiest way to declare a global is with
the P<allow_globals> parameter.

Since all components run in the same package, you'll be able to set
the global in one component and access it in all the others.

Autohandlers are common places to assign values to globals.  Use the
<tt>&lt;%once&gt;</tt> section if the global only needs to be
initialized at load time, or the <tt>&lt;%init&gt;</tt> section if it
needs to be initialized every request.

=head2 Sessions

Mason does not have a built-in session mechanism, but several
external options are available:

=over

=item *

HTML::Mason::Request::WithApacheSession, available from CPAN,
adds a cookie-based session to every request.

=item *

Apache::Session, available from CPAN, can be integrated with about a
page of code in a handler.pl. This is more complex but more flexible
than the above. See the Mason Sessions How-To at
http://www.masonhq.com/user/adpacifico/ApacheSessionMason.html for a
complete guide.

=back

=head2 Data caching

Data caching is implemented with DeWitt Clinton's C<Cache::Cache>
module.  For full understanding of this section you should read the
documentation for C<Cache::Cache> as well as for relevant subclasses
(e.g. C<Cache::FileCache>).

=over 4

=item Cache files

By default, C<Cache::FileCache> is the subclass used for data caching,
although this may be overriden by the developer. C<Cache::FileCache>
creates a separate subdirectory for every component that uses caching,
and one file some number of levels underneath that subdirectory for
each cached item.  The root of the cache tree is
P<data_dir>/C<cache>. The name of the cache subdirectory for a component
is determined by the function C<HTML::Mason::Utils::data_cache_namespace>.

=item Default constructor options

Ordinarily, when C<< $m->cache >> is called, Mason passes to the cache
constructor the C<namespace>, C<username>, and C<cache_root> options,
along with any other options given in the C<< $m->cache >> method.

You may specify other default constructor options with the
P<data_cache_defaults> parameter. For example,

    data_cache_defaults =>
       { cache_class => 'SizeAwareFileCache',
         cache_depth => 2,
         default_expires_in => '1 hour' }

Any options passed to individual C<< $m->cache >> calls override these
defaults.

=item Disabling data caching

If for some reason you want to disable data caching entirely, use

    data_cache_defaults => {cache_class => 'NullCache'}

This subclass faithfully implements the cache API but never stores data.

=back

=head1 PERFORMANCE

This section explains Mason's various performance enhancements and how
to administer them.

=head2 Code cache

When Mason loads a component, it places it in a memory cache.

The maximum size of the cache is specified with the
P<code_cache_max_size> parameter.  When the cache fills up, Mason
frees up space by discarding a number of components. The discard
algorithm is least frequently used (LFU), with a periodic decay to
gradually eliminate old frequency information. In a nutshell, the
components called most often in recent history should remain in the
cache.  Very large components (over 20% of the maximum cache size)
never get cached, on the theory that they would force out too many
other components.

Note that the "size" of a component in memory cannot literally be
measured.  It is estimated by the length of the source text plus some
overhead.  Your process growth will not match the code cache
size exactly.

You can prepopulate the cache with components that you know will be
accessed often; see L<Preloading|"Preloading">. Note that preloaded components
possess no special status in the cache and can be discarded like any
others.

Naturally, a cache entry is invalidated if the corresponding component
source file changes.

To turn off code caching completely, set P<code_cache_max_size> to 0.

=head2 Object files

The in-memory code cache is only useful on a per-process basis.  Each
process must build and maintain its own cache. Shared memory caches
are conceivable in the future, but even those will not survive between
web server restarts.

As a secondary, longer-term cache mechanism, Mason stores a compiled
form of each component in an object file under P<data_dir>/C<obj>. Any
server process can eval the object file and save time on parsing the
component source file.  The object file is recreated whenever the
source file changes.

Besides improving performance, object files can be useful for
debugging.  If you feel the need to see what your source has been
translated into, you can peek inside an object file to see exactly how
Mason converted a given component to a Perl object. This is crucial
for pre-1.10 Mason, in which error line numbers are based on the
object file rather than the source file.

If you change any Compiler or Lexer parameters, you must remove object
files previously created under that compiler or lexer for the changes
to take effect.

If for some reason you don't want Mason to create object files, set
P<use_object_files> to 0.

=head2 Preloading

You can tell Mason to preload a set of components in the parent
process, rather than loading them on demand, using the P<preloads>
parameter.  Each child server will start with those components loaded
in the memory cache. The trade-offs are:

=over

=item time

a small one-time startup cost, but children save time by not
having to load the components

=item memory

a fatter initial server, but the memory for preloaded components are
shared by all children.  This is similar to the advantage of using
modules only in the parent process.

=back

Try to preload components that are used frequently and do not change
often.  (If a preloaded component changes, all the children will have
to reload it from scratch.)

=head2 Static source mode

As described above, Mason checks the timestamp of a component source
file every time that component is called. This can add up to a lot
of file stats.

If you have a live site with infrequent and well-controlled updates,
you may choose to use P<static_source> mode. In this mode Mason will
not check source timestamps when it uses an in-memory cache or object
file.  The disadvantage is that you must remove object files and
restart the server whenever you change component source; however this
process can be easily automated.

=head1 ERROR REPORTING

When an error occurs, Mason can respond by:

=over

=item *

showing a detailed error message in the browser in HTML.

=item *

die'ing, which sends a 501 to the browser and lets the error message go to the
error logs.

=back

The first behavior is ideal for development, where you want immediate
feedback on the error.  The second behavior is usually desired for
production so that users are not exposed to messy error messages.  You
choose the behavior by setting P<error_mode> to "output" or "fatal"
respectively.

=head1 CONFIGURING VIRTUAL SITES

These examples extend the single site configurations given so far.

=head2 Multiple sites, one component root

If you want to share some components between your sites, arrange your
httpd.conf so that all DocumentRoots live under a single component space:

    # Web site #1
    <VirtualHost www.site1.com>
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/www/htdocs/site1
        <Location />
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

    # Web site #2
    <VirtualHost www.site2.com>
        DocumentRoot /usr/local/www/htdocs/site2
        <Location />
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

    # Mason configuration
    PerlSetVar MasonCompRoot "/usr/local/www/htdocs"
    PerlSetVar MasonDataDir "/usr/local/mason"
    PerlModule HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler

The directory structure for this scenario might look like:

    /usr/local/www/htdocs/  # component root
        +- shared/          # shared components
        +- site1/           # DocumentRoot for first site
        +- site2/           # DocumentRoot for second site

Incoming URLs for each site can only request components in their
respective DocumentRoots, while components internally can call other
components anywhere in the component space. The shared/ directory
is a private directory for use by components, inaccessible from
the Web.

=head2 Multiple sites, multiple component roots

Sometimes your sites need to have completely distinct component
hierarchies, e.g. if you are providing Mason ISP services for multiple
users. In this case the component root must change depending on the
site requested. Since you can't change an interpreter's component root
dynamically, you need to maintain separate C<ApacheHandler> objects
for each site in your C<handler.pl>:

    my %ah;
    foreach my $site (qw(site1 site2 site3)) {
        $ah{$site} = new HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
            (comp_root => "/usr/local/www/$site",
             data_dir => "/usr/local/mason/$site");
    }

    ...

    sub handler {
        my ($r) = @_;
        my $site = $r->dir_config('site');
        $ah{$site}->handle_request($r);
    }

We assume each virtual server configuration section has a

    PerlSetVar site <site_name>

Above we pre-create all Mason objects in the parent. Another scheme is to
create objects on demand in the child:

    my %ah;

    ...

    sub handler {
        my ($r) = @_;
        my $site = $r->dir_config('site');
        unless exists($ah{$site}) {
            # get comp_root from PerlSetVar as well
            my $comp_root = $r->dir_config('comp_root');
            $ah{$site} = new HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler(comp_root=>$comp_root,...);
        }
    }

The advantage of the second scheme is that you don't have to hardcode
as much information in the C<handler.pl>. The disadvantage is a slight
memory and performance impact. On development servers this shouldn't
matter; on production servers you may wish to profile the two schemes.

=head1 RUNNING OUTSIDE OF MOD_PERL

Although Mason is most commonly used in conjunction with mod_perl, the
APIs are flexible enough to use in any environment. Below we describe
the two most common alternative environments, CGI and standalone
scripts.

=head2 Using Mason from a CGI script

The easiest way to use Mason via a CGI script is with the L<CGIHandler
module|HTML::Mason::CGIHandler> module.

Here is a skeleton CGI script that calls a component and sends the
output to the browser.

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use HTML::Mason::CGIHandler;

    my $h = new HTML::Mason::CGIHandler
     (
      data_dir  => '/home/jethro/code/mason_data',
     );

    $h->handle_request;

The relevant portions of the httpd.conf file look like:

    DocumentRoot /path/to/comp/root
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /path/to/cgi-bin/

    Action html-mason /cgi-bin/mason_handler.cgi
    <FilesMatch "\.html$">
     SetHandler html-mason
    </FilesMatch>

This simply causes Apache to call the mason_handler.cgi script every
time a file under the component root is requested.  This script uses
the L<CGIHandler class|HTML::Mason::CGIHandler> to do most of the
heavy lifting.  See that class's documentation ofr more details.

=head2 Using Mason from a standalone script

Mason can be used as a pure text templating solution -- like
Text::Template and its brethren, but with more power (and of course
more complexity).

Here is a bare-bones script that calls a component file and sends
the result to standard output:

    my $interp = HTML::Mason::Interp->new ();
    $interp->exec(<absolute-file-path>, <args>...);

Because no component root was specified, the root is set to '/' and
any file on the system may be used as a component. If you have a
well defined and contained component tree, you'll probably want to
specify a component root.

Because no data directory was specified, object files will not be
created and data caching will not work in the default manner. If
performance is an issue, you will want to specify a data directory.

Here's a slightly fuller script that specifies a component root and
data directory, and captures the result in a variable rather than
sending to standard output:

    my $outbuf;
    my $interp = HTML::Mason::Interp->new
        (comp_root  => '/path/to/comp_root',
         data_dir   => '/path/to/data_dir',
         out_method => \$outbuf
         );
    $interp->exec(<component-path>, <args>...);
