HTML::Mason::Commands - Mason command reference

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This was the documentation for the C<mc_> command set. In Mason 0.8 and
beyond, C<mc_> commands have been merged into the new Request API. e.g.

   mc_comp becomes $m->comp
   mc_file becomes $m->file
   etc.

Below is a description of how to convert your C<mc_> commands to C<$m>
methods. There is also a utility provided with the distribution,
bin/convert0.8.pl, that performs most of these conversions for you.
For backwards compatibility C<mc_> commands still work for a
limited time but will eventually go away.
