=head1 NAME

HTML::Mason::Request - Mason Request Class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $m->abort (...)
    $m->comp (...)
    etc.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Request API is your gateway to all Mason features not provided by
syntactic tags. Mason creates a new Request object for every web
request. Inside a component you
access the current request object via the global C<$m>.

=head1 COMPONENT PATHS

The methods C<comp>, C<comp_exists>, C<fetch_comp>, and
C<process_comp_path> take a component path as argument.

=over

=item *

If the path is absolute (starting with a '/'), then the component is
found relative to the component root.

=item *

If the path is relative (no leading '/'), then the component is found
relative to the current component directory.

=item *

If the path matches both a subcomponent and file-based component, the
subcomponent takes precedence.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item abort ([return value])

Ends the current request, finishing the page without returning
through components. The optional argument specifies the return
value from C<Interp::exec>; in a web environment, this ultimately
becomes the HTTP status code.

=item cache ([action=>'retrieve|store|expire|keys'], [key=>name],
[value=>data], [keep_in_memory=>0|1], [expire options...])

C<$m-E<gt>cache> lets you store and retrieve the results
of computation for improved performance. Each component has its own
data cache for storing one or more key/value pairs. The cache is
implemented as a DBM database. See the L<Devel/data caching>
section of the I<Component Developer's Guide> for examples
and caching strategies.

The argument to I<action> is one of:

o I<retrieve>: returns the cache value if successful, or C<undef>
if there was no value or if it has expired.

o I<store>: stores a new cache value under the given key.
Default key is 'main'.

o I<expire>: expires a given cache value or values.
key may be a single key or a list reference. Default key is 'main'.

o I<keys>: returns a list of all the keys in the cache.

I<value> defines what to store. It can be a scalar or a reference to
an arbitrary data structure. The allowable size depends on your DBM
implementation.

I<keep_in_memory> indicates whether to save the value in memory once it is
retrieved. Default is 0, meaning that the value will be retrieved from
the cache file each time. If 1, each child server that retrieves this
value will save its own copy, which can result in substantial memory
usage for larger values. Use sparingly.

The various expiration options are:

o I<expire_at>: takes an absolute expiration time, in Perl time() format
(number of seconds since the epoch)

o I<expire_in>: takes a relative expiration time of the form
"<num><unit>", where <num> is a positive number and <unit> is one of
seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks, or any abbreviation thereof.
E.g. "10min", "30m", "1hour".

o I<expire_next>: takes a string, either 'hour' or 'day'. It indicates
an expiration time at the top of the next hour or day.

o I<expire_if>: calls a given anonymous subroutine and expires if the
subroutine returns a non-zero value. The subroutine is called with one
parameter, the time when the cache value was last written.

=for html <a name="item_cache_self">

=item cache_self (... same as $m->cache options...)

Uses C<$m-E<gt>cache> to cache the entire output and/or the return value of
the current component.  It is typically used right at the top of an
C<E<lt>%init%E<gt>> section.

To cache the component's output:

    <%init>
        return if $m->cache_self(expire_in=>'3 hours'[, key=>'fookey']);
        ... <rest of init> ...
    </%init>

To cache the component's return value:

    <%init>
        my ($retval,$cached) = $m->cache_self(expire_in=>'3 hours'[, key=>'fookey']);
        return $retval if $cached;
        ... <rest of init> ...
    </%init>

This only works with scalar and reference return values.

C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> handles both the retrieve and store, so you can pass
both kinds of options to it. See C<$m-E<gt>cache> for an explanation of
options.

C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> uses a bit of magic to accomplish everything in one
line.  You can use it without understanding it, but if you're
curious, here's how it works:

o A component foo calls C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> for the first time.

o C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> sees that the cache is empty and calls foo again
recursively, with a STORE option to capture its content into a buffer.

o foo again calls C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> which immediately returns 0 this time.

o foo goes about its business and generates content into the C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> buffer.

o When control is returned to C<$m-E<gt>cache_self>, it stores the content and
return value in the cache and also outputs the content normally.
Finally C<$m-E<gt>cache_self> returns the list (retval,1) which in turn
causes foo to return immediately.

=item caller_args

Returns a list reference of the arguments passed by the component at
the specified stack level. e.g.

    $m->caller_args(0)   # arguments passed to current component
    $m->caller_args(-1)  # arguments passed to top-level component

=for html <a name="callers">

=item callers

With no arguments, returns the current component stack as a list of
component objects, starting with the current component and ending with
the top-level component. With one numeric argument, returns the
component object at that index in the list. e.g.

    $m->callers(0)      # current component
    $m->callers(1)      # component that called us
    $m->callers(-1)     # top-level component

=item call_next ([args...])

Calls the component intercepted by an autohandler.  With no arguments,
the original arguments are passed to the component.  Any arguments
specified here serve to augment and override (in case of conflict) the
original arguments. Works like C<$m-E<gt>comp> in terms of return value and
scalar/list context.  See the L<Devel/autohandlers> section of the
I<Component Developer's Guide> for examples.

=for html <a name="comp">
=item comp (comp, option=>value, ...)

Calls the component designated by I<comp> with the specified
option/value pairs. I<comp> may be a component path or a component
object. 

Components work exactly like Perl subroutines in terms of return
values and context. A component can return any type of value, which is
then returned from the C<$m-E<gt>comp> call.

The <& &> tag provides a convenient shortcut for C<$m-E<gt>comp>.

=item comp_exists (comp_path)

Returns 1 if I<comp_path> is the path of an existing component, 0 otherwise. 

=item count

Returns the number of this request, which is unique for a given
request and interpreter.

=for html <a name="current_comp">

=item current_comp

Returns the current component object.

=item decline

Used from a top-level component or dhandler, this method aborts the
current request and restarts with the next applicable dhandler
up the tree. If no dhandler is available, an error occurs.
This method bears no relation to the Apache DECLINED status
except in name.

=item depth

Returns the current size of the component stack.  The lowest possible
value is 1, which indicates we are in the top-level component.

=item dhandler_arg

If the request has been handled by a dhandler, this method returns the
remainder of the URI or C<Interp::exec> path when the dhandler directory is
removed.  Otherwise returns undef.

=for html <a name="fetch_comp">

=item fetch_comp (comp_path)

Given a I<comp_path>, returns the corresponding component object or
undef if no such component exists.

=item fetch_next

Returns the component object intercepted by an autohandler.  See the
L<Devel/autohandlers> section of the I<Component Developer's Guide>
for usage and examples.

=item file (filename)

Returns the contents of filename as a string. I<filename> may be an
absolute filesystem path (starting with a '/') or relative (no leading
'/'). If relative, Mason prepends the static file root, or the current
component directory if no static file root is defined.

=item file_root

Returns the static file root, used by C<$m-E<gt>file> to resolve relative
filenames.

=item flush_buffer

Flushes the Mason output buffer. Under mod_perl, also sends HTTP
headers if they haven't been sent and calls $r->rflush to flush the
Apache buffer. Flushing the initial bytes of output can make your
servers appear more responsive.

=item interp

Returns the Interp object associated with this request.

=item out (string)

Print the given I<string>. Rarely needed, since normally all HTML is just
placed in the component body and output implicitly. C<$m-E<gt>out> is useful
if you need to output something in the middle of a Perl block.

C<$m-E<gt>out> should be used instead of C<print> or C<$r-E<gt>print>,
since C<$m-E<gt>out> may be redirected or buffered depending on the
current state of the interpreter.

=item parser

Returns the Parser object associated with this request.

=item process_comp_path (comp_path)

Given a I<comp_path>, returns the corresponding absolute component path.

=item scomp

Like C<$m-E<gt>comp>, but returns the component output as a string
instead of printing it. (Think sprintf versus printf.) The
component's return value is discarded.

=item time

Returns the interpreter's notion of the current time in Perl time()
format (number of seconds since the epoch).

By using C<$m-E<gt>time> rather than calling time() directly, you enable
the option of previewer or port-based time/date simulations. e.g.
a port that looks one day into the future.

=back

=head1 APACHE-ONLY METHODS

These additional methods are available when running Mason with mod_perl
and the ApacheHandler.

=over

=item ah

Returns the ApacheHandler object associated with this request.

=item http_input

Returns the input string for this HTTP request: for GET, the query
string, and for POST, the content block read from the client. Because
$r->content can only be called once and is automatically called by
Mason, it cannot be called directly inside components; this method is
a good way to get at the value of $r->content.

=item apache_req

Returns the Apache request object.  This is also available in the
global $r.
