<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION 

</A></H1>
Mason is a tool for building, serving and managing large web sites. Its
features make it an ideal backend for high load sites serving dynamic
content, such as online newspapers or database driven e-commerce sites.


<P>

Mason's various pieces revolve around the notion of ``components''. A
component is a mix of HTML, Perl, and special Mason commands, one component
per file. So-called ''top-level`` components represent entire web-pages,
while smaller components typically return HTML snippets for embedding in
top-level components. This object-like architecture greatly simplifies site
maintenance: change a shared component, and you instantly changed all
dependant pages that refer to it across a site (or across many virtual
sites).


<P>

Mason's component syntax lets designers separate a web page into
programmatic and design elements. This means the esoteric Perl bits can be
hidden near the bottom of a component, preloading simple variables for use
above in the HTML. In our own experience, this frees content managers
(i.e., non-programmers) to work on the layout without getting mired in
programming details. Techies, however, still enjoy the full power of Perl.


<P>

One of the best ways to learn about Mason is to explore the samples/
directory created during installation. There you will find a collection of
components, simple to complex, illustrating most of Mason's component
syntax.


<P>

Other Mason features include: 


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Caching">Caching

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason caches components after compilation, and offers an internal, shared,
expireable data cache for use by components themselves.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Debugging">Debugging

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason includes a debugging mode whereby HTTP requests can be captured to
``debug files'' for later replay inside Perl's command-line debugger (as
opposed to the non-interactive mod_perl interpreter).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Previewer">Previewer

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason includes a powerful previewing utility which acts as a proxy between
Mason and incoming requests. Using a web interface, users create ``port
profiles'' that massage requests in all kinds of interesting ways:
different browsers may be simulated, different request ports, different
times of day, etc.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Standalone_Use">Standalone Use

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason is optimized for use with mod_perl, but can also be used from CGI or
as a standalone tool to generate other types of dynamic text files (similar
to Text::Template, ePerl, etc.). To learn more about this option see the
STANDALONE MODE section in
<STRONG><A HREF="././Interp.html#">HTML::Mason::Interp</A></STRONG>.


<P>

</DL>
Mason works by intercepting innocent-looking requests (say, <A
HREF="http://www.yoursite.com/index.html)">http://www.yoursite.com/index.html)</A>
and mapping them to requests for Mason components. Mason then compiles the
component, runs it, and feeds the output back to the client.


<P>

Consider this simple Mason component:


<P>

<PRE>    % my $noun = 'World';
    Hello &lt;% $noun %&gt;!
    How are ya?
</PRE>

<P>

The output of this component is: 


<P>

<PRE>    Hello World!
    How are ya?
</PRE>

<P>

In this component you see a mix of standard HTML and Mason elements. The
bare '%' prefixing the first line tells Mason that this is a line of Perl
code. One line below, the embedded &lt;%
...&nbsp;%&gt; tag gets replaced with the return value of its contents, evaluated as a
Perl expression.


<P>

Beyond this trivial example, components can also embed serious chunks of
Perl code (say, to pull records from a database). They can also call other
components, cache results for later reuse, and perform all the tricks you
expect from a regular Perl program. See
<STRONG>HTML::Mason::Components</STRONG> for a full tutorial on building, using and debugging Mason components.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation">INSTALLATION 

</A></H1>
Mason has been tested under Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris, but not yet (by
us) under Win32. As an all-Perl solution, though, it should work on any
machine that has working versions of Perl 5.004+, mod_perl, and the
required CPAN modules.


<P>

Mason has a standard MakeMaker-driven installation. See the README file for
details.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="configuring_mason">CONFIGURING MASON 

</A></H1>
Mason's configuration depends on two files: your Apache <CODE>conf</CODE> files (<A HREF="././Admin.html#item_httpd_conf">httpd.conf</A> or <CODE>srm.conf</CODE>), into which you insert directives to activate Mason's request handler,
and Mason's <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_handler_pl">handler.pl</A> file which runs at Apache startup. <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_handler_pl">handler.pl</A> does two things: it starts up Mason (which then runs persistently within
the httpd), and it defines a handler routine to receive HTTP requests.


<P>

The paragraphs below assume some knowledge of mod_perl, Apache
configuration details, and the Apache request API. If you're rusty on any
these topics, bone up by reading the documentation available at <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</A> (Apache) and <A
HREF="http://perl.apache.org">http://perl.apache.org</A> (mod_perl). Here
you will also find subscription details for the mod_perl mailing list--in
my view the best mod_perl resource around.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="single_site_configuration">Single Site Configuration 

</A></H2>
The simplest Mason component is one composed of pure HTML, so the fast
track is simply to attach Mason to some branch of your server's
DocumentRoot, like so:


<P>

<PRE>    # Additions to your httpd.conf
    PerlRequire /usr/local/mason/handler.pl
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    Alias /mason /usr/local/www/htdocs
    &lt;Location /mason&gt;
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler HTML::Mason
    &lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

These directives tell Apache to first run <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_handler_pl">handler.pl</A>, the Mason startup file. The ``Alias'' then maps any ``/mason'' URLs into
the DocumentRoot (assuming the DocumentRoot is /usr/local/www/htdocs).
Finally, the &lt;Location&gt; directive routes those requests to the handler routine <CODE>HTML::Mason::handler</CODE>.


<P>

If you want to create HTML without necessarily using the .html extension,
you might optionally change your DefaultType:


<P>

<PRE>    DefaultType text/html
</PRE>

<P>

That's it for the Apache configuration. Next you will need to configure
Mason's <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_handler_pl">handler.pl</A> file, a sample of which is in
<CODE>eg/handler.pl</CODE>. Here you must make some decisions:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Where_is_the_component_root_com">Where is the component root (comp_root)?

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason introduces the idea of a ``component root'' which, like the
DocumentRoot, is a virtual root for the component filesystem. In this
example we equate the two roots; other configurations will opt to keep them
separate.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Where_is_the_data_directory_dat">Where is the data directory (data_dir)?

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason generates various data files, which live in topical directories under
Mason's ``data directory''.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_What_is_the_UID_and_GID_that_the">What is the UID and GID that the server runs under?

</A></STRONG><DD>
If your web server is running on a privileged port like 80, the parent
process runs as root and spawns children under the 'User' and 'Group' IDs
listed in your <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_httpd_conf">httpd.conf</A>. To prevent ownership and permission conflicts, set the
<CODE>chown()</CODE> parameters to match the UID and GID from your <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_httpd_conf">httpd.conf</A>. See the <CODE>handler</CODE> section in the
<EM>Administrator's Guide</EM> guide for details.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Do_you_plan_to_intermix_images_a">Do you plan to intermix images and components in the same directory?

</A></STRONG><DD>
If you use a &lt;Location&gt; or &lt;Directory&gt; directive like the one
suggested above, then requests to any file under that directory will go to
the Mason handler. If there are images in the directory, Mason will try to
treat them like regular components. This is bad: not only is there extra
overhead, but if an image inadvertently contains a Mason character sequence
such as ``&lt;%'', Mason will try to interpret that piece and fail with a
syntax error.


<P>

The simplest remedy is to have Mason decline image and other non-HTML
requests, thus letting Apache serve them in the normal way. The following
line


<P>

<PRE>    return -1 if $r-&gt;content_type &amp;&amp; $r-&gt;content_type !~ m|^text/|io;
</PRE>

<P>

declines all requests with a content type not starting with ``text/''. This
allows text/html and text/plain to pass through but not much else. It is
included in the default handler.pl.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Are_you_running_with_taint_check">Are you running with taint checks (e.g. PerlTaintCheck)?

</A></STRONG><DD>
If so, pass the flag <A HREF="././Parser.html#item_taint_check">taint_check</A>=&gt;1 when creating the parser; this tells Mason to untaint component code
and filenames.


<P>

</DL>
Both comp_root and the data_dir are set when Mason creates a new Interp
object:


<P>

<PRE>    my $interp = new HTML::Mason::Interp (parser=&gt;$parser,
                    comp_root=&gt;'/usr/local/www/htdocs'
                    data_dir=&gt;'/usr/local/mason/');
</PRE>

<P>

Set these to your own locations, then restart the server and go to some
standard URL on your site, prefixing the URL with ``/mason''. If all goes
well you should see the same page as without the ``/mason'' prefix. If not,
recheck your Apache config files and <A HREF="././Admin.html#item_handler_pl">handler.pl</A>, and also tail your server's error log.


<P>

(If you are getting erroneous ``404 Not Found'' errors, Mason may be having
trouble with your document and component root. Make sure ``LogLevel warn''
is in your Apache configuration file, then regenerate the error and check
the error log for Mason warnings. One situation that will unfortunately
confuse Mason is if your document or component root goes through a soft
link. Try specifying your document and component root settings in terms of
the true path. On Win32 systems, make sure the document and component roots
are spelled with the same case.)


<P>

Assuming it worked, you now have a Mason ``lens'' through which to view
your HTML tree. Try adding a Mason tag to some HTML file, say &lt;% 2+2 %&gt;. If you hit Reload and see a ``4'', Mason's up and running. You
can now copy or link the <CODE>samples/</CODE> directory into your new comp_root and check out the sample components in
your browser.


<P>

Once you feel comfortable with Mason, you can ``fully'' install it by
deleting the ``Alias'' directive from your httpd.conf, and changing the
&lt;Location&gt; mapping from ``/mason'' to just ``/''. Now all URLs serve
through Mason.


<P>

the same box.

Once Mason is on its feet, the next step is to write a component or two.
The <EM>Mason Developer's Manual</EM> (<STRONG><A HREF="././Components.html#">HTML::Mason::Components</A></STRONG>) is a complete tutorial for writing, using, and debugging components. A
companion to the Developer's Manual is the Mason commands reference,
<STRONG><A HREF="././Commands.html#">HTML::Mason::Commands</A></STRONG>.


<P>

System Admins, or others interested in configuring Mason or tuning for
performance, should read <STRONG><A HREF="././Admin.html#">HTML::Mason::Admin</A></STRONG>. Details of Mason's core modules can be found in <STRONG><A HREF="././Parser.html#">HTML::Mason::Parser</A></STRONG>,
<STRONG><A HREF="././Interp.html#">HTML::Mason::Interp</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG><A HREF="././ApacheHandler.html#">HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler</A></STRONG>.


<P>

Most of this documentation assumes that you're running Mason on top of
mod_perl, since that is the most common configuration. If you are using
Mason outside of mod_perl, the documentation is still valid; you'll just
have to ignore mod_perl specific references like <CODE>$r</CODE> and the
ApacheHandler object, and you'll want to read the STANDALONE MODE section
in
<STRONG><A HREF="././Interp.html#">HTML::Mason::Interp</A></STRONG>.
